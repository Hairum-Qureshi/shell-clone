To compile the shell, run the following commands:
`make` -> creates a `desh` executable
`make clean` -> cleans all the `.o` files

This project essentially emulates the Bash shell by implementing the main commands: exit, which, list, pwd, cd, pid, and prompt. There are also some other (sub) commands as well.
